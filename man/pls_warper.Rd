\title{Partial least squares transformation of feature space}
\usage{
pls_warper(
  xdata,
  xvars,
  pvars,
  wvars = "resid",
  yvar,
  uvars = NULL,
  title = wvars
)
}
\arguments{
\item{xdata}{A data frame containing the observations in the original feature space.}

\item{xvars}{A character string identifying one feature in \code{xdata}
that should be transformed.}

\item{wvars}{A character string giving a prefix for partial residual features.}

\item{yvar}{Name of the response variable (not to be transformed)}

\item{uvars}{Names of additional variables that should remain untouched.}

\item{title}{Optional name of the transformation, may be used for printing summaries
or for plotting.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{warper}, \code{rotation_warper} and \code{pls_warper}.
}
\description{
This function generates a \code{warper} object based on a partial least squares
transformation with respect to a selected feature.
}
\details{
The function will make an effort to ensure that there's no overlap
between \code{xvars}, \code{uvars} and \code{yvar}; however, ideally
these arguments should not overlap.
