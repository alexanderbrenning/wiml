Description: Main effects plots (such as partial dependence and ALE plots) can 
    be confusing and even misleading when dealing with large numbers of highly 
    correlated features. Example applications include land cover classification 
    using multitemporal satellite remote-sensing data or texture features derived 
    from such imagery. This package introduces a simple and pragmatic approach to 
    dealing with this problem. This approach can be especially beneficial in 
    situations where features tend to be linearly dependent, or in other words, 
    where principal component analysis seems like a reasonable approach. Please 
    refer to the paper on arXiv for details.
